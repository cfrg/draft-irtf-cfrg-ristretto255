<abstract>
<t>This memo specifies a prime-order group, ristretto255, suitable for
safely implementing higher-level and complex cryptographic protocols.
The ristretto255 group can be implemented using Curve25519, allowing
existing Curve25519 implementations to be reused and extended to provide
a prime-order group.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Ristretto is a technique for constructing prime-order groups with
non-malleable encodings from non-prime-order elliptic curves.  It
extends the <xref target="Decaf"></xref> approach to cofactor elimination to support
cofactor-8 curves such as Curve25519 <xref target="RFC7748"></xref>. In particular, this
allows an existing Curve25519 library to provide a prime-order group
with only a thin abstraction layer.</t>
<t>Edwards curves provide a number of implementation benefits for
cryptography, such as complete addition formulas with no exceptional
points and the fastest known formulas for curve operations.  However,
every Edwards curve has a point of order 4. Thus, the group of
points on the curve is not of prime order but has a small cofactor.</t>
<t>This abstraction mismatch is usually handled by means of ad-hoc
protocol tweaks (such as multiplying by the cofactor in an
appropriate place), or not at all.</t>
<t>Even for simple protocols such as signatures, these tweaks can cause
subtle issues.  For instance, Ed25519 implementations may have
different validation behaviour between batched and singleton
verification, and at least as specified in <xref target="RFC8032"></xref>, the set of
valid signatures is not defined by the standard.</t>
<t>For more complex protocols, careful analysis is required as the
original security proofs may no longer apply, and the tweaks for one
protocol may have disastrous effects when applied to another (for
instance, the octuple-spend vulnerability in <xref target="Monero"></xref>).</t>
<t>Decaf and Ristretto fix this abstraction mismatch in one place for
all protocols, providing an abstraction to protocol implementors that
matches the abstraction commonly assumed in protocol specifications,
while still allowing the use of high-performance curve
implementations internally.</t>
<t>While Ristretto is a general method, and can be used in conjunction
with any Edwards curve with cofactor 4 or 8, this document specifies
the ristretto255 group, which MAY be implemented using Curve25519.</t>
<t>The abstraction layer imposes minor overhead, and certain operations
(like equality) are faster than corresponding operations on the elliptic
curve points used internally.</t>
<t>It is also possible and allowed for interoperable ristretto255
implementations to use a different elliptic curve internally, but that
construction is out-of-scope for this document.</t>
<t>The Ristretto construction is described and justified in detail at
<eref target="https://ristretto.group">https://ristretto.group</eref>.</t>

<t>Readers are cautioned that the term &quot;Curve25519&quot; has varying
interpretations in the literature, and that the canonical meaning of the
term has shifted over time. Originally it referred to a specific
Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism. Over time, use shifted, and
&quot;Curve25519&quot; has been used to refer to either the abstract underlying
curve, or its concrete representation in Montgomery form, or the
specific Diffie-Hellman mechanism. This document uses the term
&quot;Curve25519&quot; to refer to the abstract underlying curve, as recommended
in <xref target="Naming"></xref>.</t>
<t>Elliptic curve points in this document are represented in extended
Edwards coordinates in the (x, y, z, t) format <xref target="Twisted"></xref>. All formulas
specify field operations unless otherwise noted.</t>
<t>Field elements are values modulo p, the Curve25519 prime <tt>2^255 - 19</tt>,
as specified in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7748"></xref>.</t>
<t>The | symbol represents a constant-time OR.</t>

<section anchor="interface"><name>The group abstraction</name>
<t>Ristretto implements an abstract prime-order group interface
that exposes only the behavior that is useful to higher-level protocols,
without leaking curve-related details and pitfalls.</t>
<t>The only operations exposed by the abstract group are decoding,
encoding, equality, a one-way map, addition, negation, and the
derived subtraction and (multi-)scalar multiplication.</t>
<t>Decoding is a function from bytestrings to abstract elements with
built-in validation, so that only the canonical encodings of valid
elements are accepted. The built-in validation avoids the need for
explicit invalid curve checks.</t>
<t>Encoding is a function from abstract elements to bytestrings so that all
equivalent representations of the same element are encoded as identical
bytestrings. Decoding the output of the encoding function always
succeeds and returns an equivalent element to the encoding input.</t>
<t>The equality check reports whether two representations of an abstract
element are equivalent.</t>
<t>The one-way map is a function from fixed-length uniformly distributed
bytestrings to uniformly distributed abstract elements. This map is not
invertible and is suitable for hash-to-group operations and to select
random elements.</t>
<t>Addition is the group operation. The group has an identity element and
prime order. Adding an element to itself as many time as the order of
the group returns the identity element. Adding the identity element to
any element returns that element unchanged. Negation returns an element
that added to the negation input returns the identity element.
Subtraction is the addition of a negated element, and scalar
multiplication is the repeated addition of an element.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ristretto255"><name>ristretto255</name>
<t>ristretto255 is an instantiation of the abstract prime-order group
interface defined in <xref target="interface"></xref>. This documents describes how to
implement the ristretto255 prime-order group using Curve25519 points as
internal representations.</t>
<t>A &quot;ristretto255 group element&quot; is the abstract element of the prime
order group. An &quot;element encoding&quot; is the unique reversible encoding
of a group element. An &quot;internal representation&quot; is a point on the
curve used to implement ristretto255. Each group element can have
multiple equivalent internal representations.</t>
<t>Encoding, decoding, equality, and one-way map are defined in
<xref target="functions"></xref>. Element addition, subtraction, negation, and scalar
multiplication are implemented by applying the corresponding operations
directly to the internal representation.</t>
<t>The group order is the same as the order of the Curve25519 prime-order subgroup:</t>

<artwork>l = 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493
</artwork>
<t>Since ristretto255 is a prime-order group, every element except the
identity is a generator, but for interoperability a canonical generator
is selected, which can be internally represented by the Curve25519
basepoint, enabling reuse of existing precomputation for scalar
multiplication. This is its encoding:</t>

</artwork>
<t>Implementations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expose either the internal representation
or its field implementation and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expose any operations
defined on the internal representations unless specified in this
document.</t>

</ul>
<t>The computation is similar to Section 5.1.3 of <xref target="RFC8032"></xref>, with the
difference that if the input is non-square, the function returns a

<section anchor="api"><name>API Considerations</name>
<t>ristretto255 is an abstraction which implements a prime-order group, and
ristretto255 elements are represented by curve points, but they are not
curve points. The API needs to reflect that: the type representing an
element of the group <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be opaque and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> expose the
underlying curve point or field elements.</t>
<t>It should be possible for a ristretto255 implementation to change its
underlying curve without causing any breaking change. The ristretto255
construction is carefully designed so that this will be the case, as
long as implementations do not expose internal representations or
operate on them except as described in this document. In particular,
implementations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> define the ristretto255 functions as
operating on arbitrary curve points, and they <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> construct
group elements except via decoding and the one-way map. They are however
allowed to apply any optimization strategy to the internal
representations as long as it doesn't change the exposed behavior of the
API.</t>
<t>It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that implementations do not perform a decoding and
encoding operation for each group operation, as it is inefficient and
unnecessary. Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> instead provide an opaque type
to hold the internal representation through multiple operations.</t>

<section anchor="iana-considerations"><name>IANA Considerations</name>
<t>This document has no IANA actions.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>The ristretto255 group provides higher-level protocols with the
abstraction they expect: a prime-order group. Therefore, it's expected
to be safer for use in any situation where Curve25519 is used to
implement a protocol requiring a prime-order group. Note that the
safety of the abstraction can be defeated by
implementations that do not follow the guidance in <xref target="api"></xref>.</t>
<t>There is no function to test whether an elliptic curve point is a
valid internal representation of a group element.  The decoding
function always returns a valid internal representation, or an error, and
allowed operations on valid internal representations return valid
internal representations.  In this way, an implementation can maintain
the invariant that an internal representation is always valid, so that
checking is never necessary, and invalid states are unrepresentable.</t>
